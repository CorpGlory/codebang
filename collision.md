#### Collision

Slabs collide at moment $t^n$, we merge $B$ and $C$ and set following: $\Sigma_B = \Sigma_C$, where $\Sigma$ is tension.

Boundary conditions for the *side bar*s we find at moment $t^n$ as follows. Let's add a *mock node* $i - 1/2$ with *bars* $i - 1$ and $i$ which we will use only for computations. 
This *mock node* we place to the left corner of the right stab.

And we suposse following for the *mock node*:

$\begin{align}
\Sigma^n_{i-1/2} = 0 ; \phi^n_{i-1/2} = 0
\end{align}$
